# STAKE

Source code used for performance and energy consumption evaluation of the STAKE protocol,
and comparison with the classical PKI protocol. The code is configured for compilation on a PC.
Before using it on microcontrollers, it is necessary to remove console printing and insert
appropriate measurement signals into the code.

**The code is not recommended for use in applications without adding a suitable source of randomness.**
